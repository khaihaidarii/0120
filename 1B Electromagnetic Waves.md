# 1B - Electromagnetic Waves

### What is light?

Electromagnetic theory - Maxwell's crowning achievement, predicts that accelerating charges should generate waves - waves made up of changing electric and magnetic fields. The changing electric field causes a changing magnetic field, which in turn generates a changing electric field - and so on. This type of wave doesn't need a medium to propagate, unlike other mechanical waves such as sound, that need a medium to propagate. These waves travel through a vacuum at the speed of light, c: $3.00 \times 10^8ms^{-1}$. The electric and magnetic fields are always at right angles to each other and the waves are also always transverse because the electric and magnetic fields are always perpendicular to the direction of travel of the waves.

The wavelength ($\lambda$) as shown in Figure 1B - 2 is the same for both the electric and the magnetic fields. All electro magnetic waves obey the wave equation ($v = f\lambda$) , and have the same speed in a vacuum, equal to $c$ - the speed of light. In other media EM waves travel more slowly ; for example, the speed of green light in water is $2.25 \times 10^8 ms^{-1}$.

#### The wave equation for Electromagnetic Waves ^1de049
$$
c = f\lambda
$$
Where:
- $c$ : Speed of light in a vacuum ( $3.00 \times 10^8ms^{-1}$ )
- $f$ : Frequency of the wave ( $Hz$ )
- $\lambda$ : Wavelength of the wave ( $meters$ )
#### Key takeaways:
- Changing electric field causes a changing magnetic field, which in turn generates a changing electric field - and so on.
- Electromagnetic waves (EM) do not need a medium to propagate, unlike other mechanical waves such as sound.
- EMs travel through a vacuum at the speed of light, c, $3.00 \times 10^8 ms^{-1}$ .
- EMs are transverse waves because the electric and magnetic fields are always perpendicular to the direction of travel of the wave.
- The electric and magnetic fields are always at a $90\degree$ to each other.
- The wavelength of an electromagnetic wave is the same as the wavelength of both the electric and magnetic fields.
- EM waves travel at the speed of light through a vacuum, however they travel slower in other mediums.

### The Electromagnetic Spectrum

Maxwell predicted that there could be a whole family of electromagnetic waves with a range of wavelengths and frequencies. He was right. We now call this the electromagnetic spectrum.

[[1B - Electromagnetic Waves#^b900dd|Figure 1B - 3]] shows the relation between wavelength and frequency for electromagnetic waves. The speed of EM waves is constant - the speed of light - therefore increasing the frequency decreases the wavelength. 

The EM spectrum is broken up into approximate regions based on wavelength. The longest wavelength being radio waves and the shortest gamma rays. Between them, in order of decreasing wavelength (increasing frequency), are microwave, infrared (IR), visible light, ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray. 

#### Key takeaways:
- Since the speed of EM waves is constant - speed of light, increasing the frequency decreases the wavelength and vice versa. 
- The region with the longest wavelength (smallest frequency) is radio waves.
- The region with the shortest wavelength (greatest frequency) is gamma rays.

### Light from The Sun

Almost all of the energy that the Earth receives from the Sun arrives as electromagnetic radiation. The graph below shows the distribution of radiation intensity by wavelength along with the percentage of total energy emitted in the ultraviolet, visible light, near infrared, far infrared and other regions of the solar spectrum.

*Figure 1B - 4 Idealised solar spectrum*

As the graph shows, majority of the electromagnetic radiation that Earth receives is infrared (48%) and visible light (44%), with an additional 7% from ultraviolet, leaving a tiny 1% from other wavelengths. The main contribution to warming the planet comes from infrared radiation. 

We can detect visible light with our eyes, infrared with our skin and ultraviolet with instruments (and if excessive, with subsequent skin damage). 

#### Key takeaways:
- The electromagnetic radiation earth receives is:
	- 48% infrared
	- 44% visible light
	- 07% ultraviolet
	- 01% other wavelength
- We can detect:
	- visible light - with out eyes
	- infrared - with our skin
	- ultraviolet - with instruments (or skin damage if excessively exposed to)
